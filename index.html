Asmita is a nature enthusiast. She is fascinated by all living creatures on earth.  
She wants to promote love for animals across the world.  Asmita wishes to build an animal foundation 
that can provide world-class treatment to sick and old stray animals for free. 
If you are interested in animal welfare and have similar aspirations, Asmita would love 
to have a chat with you.  Asmita believes that the very first thing a child should learn
is to love mother nature and to grow a friendly relationship with the animal kind. Apart from animals Asmita loves music
and mountains. Currently, she is pursuing doctoral studies in Statistics at Bowling Green State University.
